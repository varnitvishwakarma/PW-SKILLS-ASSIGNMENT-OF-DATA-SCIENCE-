    "**Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition, also known as spectral decomposition, is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It involves breaking down a square matrix into a set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. Here's the mathematical representation of eigen-decomposition for a matrix A:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A = PDP^(-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- A is the original square matrix.\n",
    "- P is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A.\n",
    "- D is a diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of Eigen-Decomposition in linear algebra is profound:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diagonalization:** Eigen-Decomposition allows you to diagonalize a matrix, which means expressing it in a form where all off-diagonal elements are zero. This is especially useful for simplifying matrix operations and solving systems of linear differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Transformations:** Eigenvectors and eigenvalues provide insight into how a linear transformation (represented by matrix A) behaves. Eigenvectors represent the directions that are scaled (or left unchanged) by the transformation, while eigenvalues determine the scaling factor in those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications:** Eigen-Decomposition is used in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics, and data analysis. It plays a crucial role in principal component analysis (PCA), quantum mechanics, and vibration analysis, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Spectral Theorem:** Eigen-Decomposition is closely related to the spectral theorem, which states that for a real symmetric matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and the eigenvalues are real. This theorem has significant implications in physics and engineering, particularly in the diagonalization of self-adjoint operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Matrix Powers and Exponentiation:** Eigen-Decomposition simplifies the computation of matrix powers and exponentials, making it useful in solving linear differential equations involving matrices.\n",

    "**Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Condition 2: If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, it is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's prove this statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, it implies that we can form a matrix P with these eigenvectors as its columns. Thus, P is an invertible matrix because its columns are linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, let's consider the Eigen-Decomposition equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   A = PDP^(-1)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   This equation shows that A is similar to the diagonal matrix D through the similarity transformation P^(-1). Therefore, A is diagonalizable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Real Eigenvalues:** The spectral theorem guarantees that for a real symmetric matrix, all eigenvalues are real. This is important because it ensures that the eigenvalues are interpretable and can represent real-world quantities or characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthogonal Eigenvectors:** The eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are orthogonal to each other. This orthogonality property simplifies many calculations and has important applications in diagonalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diagonalization:** The spectral theorem implies that real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable. That is, they can be expressed in the form A = PDP^(-1), where P is an orthogonal matrix (the columns are orthogonal eigenvectors) and D is a diagonal matrix (with real eigenvalues).\n",
