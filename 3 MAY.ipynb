    "Q1. **What is the role of feature selection in anomaly detection?**\n",
    "   - Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by identifying and selecting the most relevant features or attributes that contribute to distinguishing anomalies from normal data. It reduces dimensionality, improves algorithm efficiency, and helps in focusing on the most discriminative aspects of the data, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **What are some common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection algorithms and how are they computed?**\n",
    "   - Common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection include Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR). These metrics are computed by comparing the model's predictions to ground truth labels or using various aspects of the algorithm's performance, such as true positives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **What is DBSCAN and how does it work for clustering?**\n",
    "   - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. It groups data points based on their density within a specified neighborhood. DBSCAN defines core points, border points, and noise points, forming clusters by connecting core points that are within a certain distance of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **How does the epsilon parameter affect the performance of DBSCAN in detecting anomalies?**\n",
    "   - The epsilon parameter (ε) in DBSCAN determines the radius of the neighborhood around each data point. It significantly affects the algorithm's performance in detecting anomalies. A smaller ε can make DBSCAN more sensitive to noise and classify more points as anomalies, while a larger ε may merge clusters and miss certain anomalies. Selecting an appropriate ε value is crucial for balancing sensitivity and specificity in anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Differences between core, border, and noise points in DBSCAN and their relation to anomaly detection?**\n",
    "   - Core points are at the center of clusters, border points are on the edges, and noise points do not belong to any cluster.\n",
    "   - Anomalies often correspond to noise points because they are isolated from clusters. Border points can also be anomalies if they are near noisy regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **How does DBSCAN detect anomalies and key parameters involved?**\n",
    "   - DBSCAN identifies anomalies by considering data points that do not belong to any cluster (noise points) as potential anomalies. The key parameters are epsilon (ε) for defining the neighborhood radius and min_samples for determining core points. Noise points or isolated data points are typically considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **What is the make_circles package in scikit-learn used for?**\n",
    "   - The `make_circles` function in scikit-learn is used to generate a synthetic dataset consisting of data points arranged in concentric circles. It's often used for testing and illustrating clustering and classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **What are local outliers and global outliers, and how do they differ?**\n",
    "   - Local outliers are data points that are outliers in their local neighborhood but may not be outliers in the global dataset. Global outliers, on the other hand, are outliers when considering the entire dataset. Local outliers are context-dependent, while global outliers are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **How can local outliers be detected using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm?**\n",
    "   - LOF measures the local density of data points and compares it to the density of their neighbors. Points with significantly lower densities than their neighbors are considered local outliers. LOF calculates anomaly scores based on this comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **How can global outliers be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm?**\n",
    "    - The Isolation Forest algorithm identifies global outliers by isolating data points with a small number of splits in a random binary tree structure. Global outliers are often those that require fewer splits to isolate, as they are far from the majority of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. **Real-world applications where local outlier detection vs. global outlier detection is more appropriate?**\n",
    "    - Local outlier detection is suitable for applications where anomalies are context-dependent, such as fraud detection in credit card transactions or network intrusion detection.\n",
    "    - Global outlier detection is appropriate when anomalies need to be identified irrespective of context, such as identifying defective products in a manufacturing process or rare diseases in healthcare data."
